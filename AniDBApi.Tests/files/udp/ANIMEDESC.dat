0|2|In the year 2015, the [i]Angels[/i], huge, tremendously powerful, alien war machines, appear in Tokyo for the second time. The only hope for mankind`s survival lies in the [i]Evangelion[/i], a humanoid fighting machine developed by [url=http://anidb.net/ch5009]NERV[/url], a special United Nations agency. Capable of withstanding anything the Angels can dish out, the Evangelions` one drawback lies in the limited number of people able to pilot them. Only a handful of teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the Angels first appeared, are able to interface with an Evangelion.<br /><br />One such teenager is [url=http://anidb.net/ch309]Ikari Shinji[/url], whose father heads the NERV team that developed and maintains the Evangelions. Thrust into a maelstrom of battles and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything.<br /><br />[i]Note: The 2003 Renewal of Evangelion is the final remastered version. It includes:[/i]<br />[ul]<br />* [i][url=http://anidb.net/a22]The original TV series[/url], episodes 1-20[/i]<br />* The Director`s Cut[i] of episodes 21-24 of the original TV series[/i]<br />* [i][url=http://anidb.net/a326]Deat
